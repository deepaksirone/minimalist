# Welcome!
I am a graduate student in [Computer Sciences](https://cs.wisc.edu){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu){:target="_blank"}. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Mike Swift](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/){:target="_blank"} to explore my interests. My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and security.

Prior to joining Wisconsin, I was a masters student at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) where I was advised by [Pramod Subramanyan](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/spramod/){:target="_blank"}. I completed my undergraduate studies from [NIT Calicut](http://www.nitc.ac.in/).
